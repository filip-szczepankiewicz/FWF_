# Siemens Implementation

### Latest compiled versions per IDEA version

|          | VE11E | VE11C | VE11B | VE11A | VD11D | VD13D | VD13A_SP04 |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| Advanced |  1.19 |  1.19 |  1.05 |  1.07 |  1.13 |  1.07 |  1.07      |
| Simple   |  1.19 |  1.19 |  -    |  -    |  -    |  -    |  -         |

_If any given IDEA version is not in the table, we have not yet developed the sequence for that platform._

### Sequence variants
There are two main sequence variants:  
* Advanced (a) - The advanced variant allows maximal freedom in the experimental design. It requires knowledge about the MRI hardware to operate correctly. 
* Simple (s) - The simple variant is robust and automated for simplified use. It includes gradient waveforms (no need for waveform library) for linear, planar and spherical b-tensor encoding and is limited to b-values of 2 ms/Âµm<sup>2</sup> to avoid duty cycle issues.

### Sequence naming convention
The full name of a sequence contains several important bits of information about its version and compatability. The convention is as follows:

    [IDEAVERSION] [*_SERVICEPACK] [_SEQNAME] [_VERSION and VARIANT] [_COMPILEDATE (yymmdd)] [*_COMMENT]

Astrisk denotes optional components.

#### Example:
    VE11C_FWF_V1.13s_190317
This is the standard FWF sequence compiled 17th March, 2019 for IDEA version VE11C using no specific service pack. It is the simple variant (variant is "s") version 1.13.
